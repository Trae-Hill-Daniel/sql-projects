# SQL Scripts

Welcome to my SQL repository! As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I am constantly developing and refining scripts to query, transform, and manage data. This repository serves as a centralized location for my collection of SQL scripts, tailored for various database platforms and purposes.

## Overview

This collection includes a variety of scripts that I use in my day-to-day BI tasks, ranging from complex analytical queries to foundational table structures. The primary goal is to maintain a version-controlled, organized library of useful SQL code.

## Supported Database Systems

The scripts within this repository are organized by the specific SQL dialect they are written in. Currently, I am focusing on the following platforms:

* **Oracle SQL**: Scripts specifically for Oracle Database environments.
* **Google BigQuery**: Standard SQL scripts optimized for Google's cloud data warehouse.
* **PostgreSQL**: Scripts for the powerful open-source object-relational database system.

## Repository Structure

To keep the scripts organized and easy to find, the repository is structured into the following directories:

* **`/Oracle`, `/BigQuery`, `/PostgreSQL`**: Each of these directories contains scripts specific to that database system.
* **`/Table_Management`**: This directory holds Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects like tables and views. These scripts might be generic or have versions for each SQL dialect.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the directories to find a script that suits your needs. You can clone the repository to your local machine or simply copy and paste the code from a specific file.
